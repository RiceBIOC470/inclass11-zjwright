% 1. Find out (without reading  the entire file) -  (a) the size of the image in
% x and y, (b) the number of z-slices, (c) the number of time points, and (d) the number of
% channels.

% 2. Write code which reads in all the channels from the 30th time point
% and displays a multicolor image of them.

% 3. Use the images from part (2). In one of the channels, the membrane is
% prominently marked. Determine the best threshold and make a binary
% mask which marks the membranes and display this mask. 

% 4. Run and display both an erosion and a dilation on your mask from part
% 3 with a structuring element which is a disk of radius 3. Explain the
% results.
